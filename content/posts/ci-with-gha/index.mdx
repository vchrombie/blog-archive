It all started with a big announcement made by the Travis CI team about their change in their pricing model. You can read about it from here, [The new pricing model for travis-ci.com](https://blog.travis-ci.com/2020-11-02-travis-ci-new-billing). It made us think about the other options we have now, [discussion](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab/issues/400).

As [@ElizabethN](https://github.com/ElizabethN) quotes
> It looks like we will either have to bite the bullet and migrate to GitHub Actions or bite a bigger one and move the whole org to GitLab & GitLab CI.

We had a few options, so I talked to [@sduenas](https://github.com/sduenas) about it, and we decided to try GitHub Actions to see how it works. I worked on creating a GHA for the toolkit and perceval. I referred to the [GitHub Actions Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) and observed a few things.
- the syntax is almost similar to that of travis solutions
- travis had a few things pre-configured in the systems, but in github actions, you need to configure them
- the documentation is  good, and it was so much of help
- it has an actively growing community around it, with forums asking and answering questions
- the UI wasn't impressive (but they have updated it during GitHub Universe, and it looks super now)
- github actions is super fast than travis.org (maybe because travis.org started throttling performance since it will be shutting down soon)

It was simple. I was able to create a workflow for the toolkit at the very first attempt. The main challenge is, there are a few tools in the GrimoireLab toolset that require services like mysql, elasticsearch, etc. The documentation and a few other built-in actions have come to the rescue.

I will share some different services which we had to use.

- MySQL - services in GitHub Actions
```yaml

    services:
      # How to use MySQL
      mysql:
        image: mysql:5.7
        env:
          MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: root
        ports:
          - 3306:3306
        options: --health-cmd="mysqladmin ping" --health-interval=10s --health-timeout=5s --health-retries=3
    
    steps:
  	...
    - name: Verify MySQL connection
      run: |
        sudo apt-get install -y mysql-client libmysqlclient-dev
        mysql --host 127.0.0.1 --port ${{ job.services.mysql.ports[3306] }} -uroot -proot -e "SHOW GRANTS FOR 'root'@'localhost'"
        mysql_tzinfo_to_sql /usr/share/zoneinfo | mysql --host 127.0.0.1 --port ${{ job.services.mysql.ports[3306] }} -uroot -proot mysql
    
    - name: Setup MySQL Database
      env:
        DB_HOST: 127.0.0.1
        DB_PORT: ${{ job.services.mysql.ports[3306] }}
      run: |
        mysql --host $DB_HOST --port $DB_PORT -uroot -proot -e "SHOW DATABASES"
```

- Elasticsearch - [elastic/elastic-github-actions](https://github.com/elastic/elastic-github-actions)
```yaml
    
    strategy:
      matrix:
        elasticsearch-version: [6.1.0, 7.2.0]
    
    steps:
 	...
    - name: Configure sysctl limits
      run: |
        sudo swapoff -a
        sudo sysctl -w vm.swappiness=1
        sudo sysctl -w fs.file-max=262144
        sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
      
    - name: Runs Elasticsearch ${{ matrix.elasticsearch-version }}
      uses: elastic/elastic-github-actions/elasticsearch@master
      with:
        stack-version: ${{ matrix.elasticsearch-version }}
      
    - name: Verify Elasticsearch connection
      run: |
        curl -fsSL "http://localhost:9200/_cat/health?h=status"
```

- Coveralls - [TheKevJames/coveralls-python](https://github.com/TheKevJames/coveralls-python)
```yaml
    
    steps:
  	...
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pip install coveralls
      
      - name: Tests and Coverage
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        run: |
          cd tests
          coverage run --source=grimoirelab_toolkit run_tests.py
          # --service=github is a workaround for bug
          # https://github.com/coveralls-clients/coveralls-python/issues/251
          coveralls --service=github
```

The coveralls gave several errors without the flag `--service=github`. I found a workaround with the help of the community.

I faced some other challenges too, which are mostly configuration issues with the database and the tools. It exposed some loopholes in the documentation of the GrimoireLab project. I spent almost two weeks scratching my head to fix such configuration issues in [ELK](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-elk), but [@mafesan](https://github.com/mafesan) helped me fix them.

I worked on all the components, porting the CI and fixing any issues with the tests like flake8 errors and incomplete configurations in the repository. Within a few weeks, we completed the job and ported all the repositories from Travis CI to GHA. You can find the issue from here, [chaoss/grimoirelab#405](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab/issues/405).

The next comes the Continuous Deployment with GitHub Actions. ðŸ‘‹
