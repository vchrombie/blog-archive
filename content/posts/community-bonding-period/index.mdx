Hello 

As we reached the end of the community bonding period, I am writing this blog post to highlight the work that was done during this period. Community Bonding Period is the time between when accepted students are announced and the time these students are expected to start coding. This time is an excellent one to introduce students to the community, get them on the right mailing lists, working with their mentors on their timeline for the summer, etc. 🤝

I planned to clarify a few doubts regarding the project, setting up meeting schedules with the mentors and work on some initial tasks before actual coding. I will list out some of the work I did over this period.

- Created a project-tracker repository to store the work, meeting logs, blog posts, and almost everything related to the GSoC project. The link to the project-tracker repo is [vchrombie/gsoc](https://github.com/vchrombie/gsoc). You can view the [project progress kanban board](https://github.com/vchrombie/gsoc/projects/1).

- We planned the schedules of the weekly meetings and setting up the communication medium with the organization members. You can find the details here, [vchrombie/gsoc#1](https://github.com/vchrombie/gsoc/issues/1).

- Worked on adding Perceval support for Zulip Backend, [vchrombie/gsoc#2](https://github.com/vchrombie/gsoc/issues/2).
  ```
  perceval zulip 'https://python.zulipchat.com/' 'importlib' -e 'BOT_EMAIL_ADDRESS' -t 'BOT_API_KEY'
  ```

- Worked on adding an enricher to enrich the GitLab comments data, [vchrombie/gsoc#4](https://github.com/vchrombie/gsoc/issues/4).

- I worked on the tasks given by the mentors for the CB period, [vchrombie/gsoc#3](https://github.com/vchrombie/gsoc/issues/3).

I have written reports sharing the weekly work in my blog. You can have a look. 👀
