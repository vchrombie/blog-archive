Hi all. For the ones who haven't heard about this news, I joined Bitergia as a Backend Developer. It has been almost a month since I joined the company. I wanted to share the work and life updates about it through this post.

I had a great experience working with [CHAOSS Community](https://chaoss.community) on the GrimoireLab project as a part of the [Google Summer of Code 2020 program](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2020/projects/6524989651550208). You can read more about it from the final report of the program, [reporte final](https://vchrombie.github.io/blog/gsoc-final-report). Also, I got the opportunity to share details about my GSoC project in the CHAOSScast, which is the CHAOSS Community podcast. Be sure to check the episode, [GSOC Pt. 2: Extending GrimoireLab projects with Ria and Venu](https://podcast.chaoss.community/21).

I started hunting for work opportunities so that I can join after the GSoC period. I prefer a remote position as traveling in the middle of a pandemic didn't seem right to me. I was also interested in working on open-source projects and communities. This was just interest but not a crucial factor.

I heard about [Bitergia](https://bitergia.com) almost a year back when I started contributing to the [GrimoireLab](https://grimoirelab.github.io) project. I was always inspired by their work. My mentors, [Valerio Cosentino](https://valeriocos.github.io), and [David Moreno Lumbreras](https://dlumbrer.github.io), are working at Bitergia. I received great help from them throughout the GSoC period. I was interested in joining Bitergia as my first work after my final year. So, I shared my idea with them and asked about it. They supported me to reach out to [Manrique](https://twitter.com/jsmanrique) and ask about it.

Very soon, I came across a few openings on the [Bitergia website](https://bitergia.com). I didn't have any second thought, and I applied for the Backend Developer position. After having to clear the whole interview process, I was offered the role. I was really excited about joining the team and working with them. So, I accepted the offer right away. It is a remote position, and most of the work is around the GrimoireLab. Read about it from here, [Meet the new Bitergians: Eva and Venu](https://blog.bitergia.com/2020/10/21/meet-the-new-bitergians-eva-and-venu).

As I said, it has been more than a month since I joined the Bitergia team officially. I started working on a new [set of tools](https://github.com/Bitergia/release-tools) to automate and generate GrimoireLab releases. I'm enjoying the work and also the team.

Until next time. :)
