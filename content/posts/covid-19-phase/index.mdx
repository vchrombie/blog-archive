Hi everyone, long time no writing lol.

After GSoC, I needed a short vacation, but it went on for almost a month. The title says it's clear why I had to take a long break. Initially, I didn't want to write this article, but later I felt there is nothing to be ashamed of. It was all fate. All I can do is keep the faith and stay strong.

It was all started on 6 September 2020. Pappa said he was not feeling well from the afternoon. I didn't have any COVID thought as we haven't gone out anytime recently. Everything was in lockdown, and we hardly went out of the home. But, the illness didn't get better even after 4 days, which made us get worried about the situation. I forced him to get tested just to clear the doubt from our mind. But, contradicting our prayers, he was tested +ve. That day must be one of the most depressing days in our home.

We didn't have much time to react, so we acted quickly. Made arrangements for home isolation, got fruits, medicines, and all the stuff that was needed. I read a lot of articles and quora answers to understand the symptoms, how the patient felt, medicines, food, diet, and about the disease. When I was making these arrangements, I totally forgot the point that we stay in one room, and I was one of the most contacted to him. I didn't even think of this until I started to show symptoms after 3 days of dad getting tested +ve.

It started with a mild headache for me on the first day and then cough on the second day. As the cough began, I became alert and isolated myself in another room. To be really honest, I was kinda expecting it. Now, we all decided to get tested as I started showing symptoms. And as expected, I was tested +ve too, along with my younger sister. I'm just glad that amma didn't get +ve result because, somewhere, we all knew that she was our backbone, and she would take care of us.

Fast forward, after almost one month of whole family home quarantine, we all went for testing again on 28 September 2020. With Lord Jagannath's grace, all of us got tested -ve. It was a huge relief as we were cured, and we didn't have any new cases in the family.

So, coming to the main reason for writing this post. We had to follow a lot of rules after we got tested +ve, various from food to living and daily habits. I want to share them as someone might find it useful.

**Note:** This was my experience and the steps we followed during our recovery. But, I'd suggest you spend time reading about it, about your symptoms, keeping your previous health conditions in mind and advise you to consult a doctor too.

##### Living

1. Stay in complete isolation (have your own things like the plate, coffee mug, water bottles, spoon, knife, and whatever you need).
2. Don't share your loo (clean and sanitize it well by yourself regularly).
3. Wash your own clothes. If you want to use a washing machine, don't mix up your clothes, and wash them 2 or 3 days once (you can use Dettol during rinse, prefer to dry under the sun).
4. You can use disposable items/plates, have a separate dustbin & garbage bags, keep your room clean.
5. If you have to use other things outside your room (think twice if it is needed), have your gloves & mask, and use disinfectant after your use.
6. Be active and have enough sleep (make a time table).
7. Keep yourself busy during free time (play games/talk to friends/watch movies/read books), have your fun time now.
8. Talk with your family (do video calls or communicate over the phone).
9. Make sure you are not suffocated in the room, open your windows, and let the fresh oxygen flow in (if it is too hot, turn on ac, and keep the temperature on 27/28).

##### Food and Drinks

10. Drink complete hot water (get a kettle for yourself, and this would be much helpful).
11. Take only hot beverages (morning kaadha, lemon in hot water, evening tea/coffee, night turmeric milk).
12. Eat healthily (you might lose your sense of taste & smell but don't skip any meal), avoid junk food.
13. Eat dry fruits, protein food (pulses, garlic, chana, rajma, paneer), and a lot of fruits (papaya, orange, apple, kiwi, etc.).
14. If you are non-veg, eat (boiled) egg one/two times a day. Try to avoid other non-veg for a few days.

##### Medication and Conditions

15. Use medication with your symptoms in mind. Better get doctor's consultation (vitamins, antibiotics, fever/headache tablets, syrup for cold/cough). Don't miss out on any existing regular medication (talk to the doctor about it).
16. Immediately report to doctor/hospital if you are having any serious symptoms (difficulty in breathing or shortness of breath, chest pain or pressure, loss of speech, or movement).
17. You need not panic about normal symptoms. (that include fever, cough, cold, sore throat, headache, diarrhea, tiredness, body ache, loss of taste & smell, but keep aware of your health condition)
18. Use a vaporizer for steam (compulsory 3-4 times a day). You can add zinda tilismath or eucalyptus oil to it. This helps to repair your lungs quickly.
19. Keep a check and note down your oximeter levels (3-4 times a day, also when you are having breathing issues).
20. Normal oximeter values are spo2 95-100, 60-100 prbpm. You need to consult a doctor immediately if the value is falling below normal (spo2 <90 and prbpm <60).
21. Do pranayama and breathing exercises.
22. Gargle with hot salt water after brushing (two times a day).

##### Finally

23. Stay positive after you have tested positive. ðŸ˜›
24. Laugh and make others laugh too. You might lose taste/smell but don't lose your sense of humor. ðŸ˜‰
25. Don't panic. It is just a bloody monster trying to eat you from inside, kill it, in your throat before it reaches your lungs. ðŸ’ª
26. Fight, fight, and fight. Don't let this virus get to your mind. Fight it. Leave the rest to God. Whatever he has decided will happen. But for now, keep fighting. âœŠ

I think I can say that I'm completely recovered from COVID-19. It has been more than a month, and I gained all my senses back with no symptoms. *"Everything happens for a reason"*, this must be true. I became more serious about my health and family too after this September Quarantine.

Until next time.
