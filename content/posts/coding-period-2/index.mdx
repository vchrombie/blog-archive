Hello 

As we reached the end of the second coding period, I am writing this blog post to highlight the work done during this period. üèÑ

- In the initial weeks, I was concentrating on making the Prosoul results dashboard. There was an existing dashboard related to the Quality Models in the crossminer project, [scava-qm dashboard](http://crossminer.bitergia.net/app/kibana#/dashboard/72ac14b0-456e-11e9-a208-9748f08b9341). I took this as a reference ‚úä, and I replicated the visualizations with the current results obtained.

- We found the possibility to add two additional metrics to the _gitlabqm_ enricher, the number of issues attended and the number of merge requests attended. I have worked on it and completed implementing the extra metrics too. [vchrombie/gsoc#8](https://github.com/vchrombie/gsoc/issues/8)

- Next, I have performed a study on the [amFOSS](https://amfoss.in/) projects as I'm a bit familiar with the projects and I have an understanding of their growth. I used two data sources gitlab and git (qm enrichers) for 10 projects and the Developer Quality Model, which has 2 goals and 4 metrics.

- Later, we started working towards adding a few more data sources to the list. We have discussed the metrics for _pipermailqm_ [vchrombie/gsoc#11](https://github.com/vchrombie/gsoc/issues/11) and _meetupqm_ [vchrombie/gsoc#14](https://github.com/vchrombie/gsoc/issues/14). I have worked on it for a few days and completed implementing all the planned metrics.

- The next target was to add tests to the existing enrichers. I had some pretty good experience working with tests as I have tried it on the gitlabcomments enricher during the Community Bonding Period. I took some inspiration from the implementation of tests and started working.

I have written reports sharing the weekly work in my blog. You can have a look. üëÄ
