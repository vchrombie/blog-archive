#### Coding Period 1, Week 4: Made our first test assessments ðŸ¤º.

Hello Everyone,

Welcome to the report of the fourth and also the last week in the first coding period phase. We had a video call this week instead of a regular IRC meeting, as I was expecting to show a demo of the work done until now. I couldn't complete the demo as I had some technical issues on in the last minute on my side. Anyway, I planned to record the demo soon. We had planned a few things for the upcoming week, [2020-06-25-coding-period-1-week-4.md](https://github.com/vchrombie/gsoc/blob/master/meetings/2020-06-25-coding-period-1-week-4.md).

This week, I completed working _gitlabqm_ enricher and also the _gitqm_ enricher. Things got pretty easy as I have a working enricher whose enriched items are consumed by Prosoul, we can perform assessments with them too. ðŸ•º

I started speeding up the process. We discussed about the possible metrics that can be extracted from the gitlab ([vchrombie/gsoc#8](https://github.com/vchrombie/gsoc/issues/8)) and git ([vchrombie/gsoc#9](https://github.com/vchrombie/gsoc/issues/9)) raw data. I worked on implementing all the planned metrics. ðŸ‘¾ [vchrombie/gsoc#6](https://github.com/vchrombie/gsoc/issues/6),  PR ðŸ‘‰ [chaoss/grimoirelab-elk#902](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-elk/pull/902)
    
- _gitlabqm_: 
    - issues
        - numberCreatedIssues
        - numberClosedIssues
        - numberIssueComments
    - merges
        - numberCreatedMerges
        - numberClosedMerges
        - numberMergedMerges
        - numberMergeComments
- _gitqm_: 
    - commits
        - numberCommitsCreated
        - numberLinesAdded
        - numberLinesRemoved
        - numberActions
        - numberFilesChanged

Now that we have two enrichers working, I've decided to play with Prosoul using the extracted metrics data. I've executed the raw and enrich tasks using micro-mordred and completed enriching items of around eight projects of [GitLab.org](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org). The project list and configurations can be viewed here, [configurations gist](https://gist.github.com/vchrombie/65824c47c0d22005a9520583856e993e).

I have used the [Developer QM](https://github.com/Bitergia/prosoul/blob/master/django-prosoul/prosoul/data/developer_model.json) to perform an assessment. The results were better. ðŸ‘Œ

I made a custom QM with all the metrics extracted until now. Well, this was just for the demo that doesn't make much sense with the actual meaning of Quality Models.

I also worked on improving the existing dashboard to have a better understanding of the enriched data. I've made a common dashboard for all the enrichers and added filters to manage the results. ðŸ¤¹ [vchrombie/gsoc#5 (comment)](https://github.com/vchrombie/gsoc/issues/5#issuecomment-650801826)

Next week, we will be working with some organizations and make some good Quality Models, test the projects of the org, and work on displaying the results.
