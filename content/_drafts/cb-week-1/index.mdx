Hello

The first month after getting selected is called the Community Bonding where the students spend a month learning more about their organization’s community. So, this blog post is the work report of what all I did during the first week of the Community Bonding.

I had a meeting with my mentors last Thursday, 7th May. This was the first community bonding meeting. You can find the log of the meeting here, [2020-05-07-community-bonding-1.txt](https://github.com/vchrombie/gsoc/blob/master/meetings/2020-05-07-community-bonding-1.txt). 

The main agenda of this meeting was to decide on the next steps. Fixing a schedule for a project meeting, mode of reporting the progress of the project, communication medium, and also to discuss the work to do during the community bonding period.

The conclusions of the meeting are

1. Need to create a project-tracker repository to store the work, meeting logs, blog posts, and almost everything related to the GSoC project.
> Created it, link to the project-tracker repo is [vchrombie/gsoc](https://github.com/vchrombie/gsoc).
2. We will be discussing the progress of this project every week at the `#grimoirelab` channel on freenode IRC (scheduled for every Thursday 17h to 18h (CEST) or 20h30 to 21h30 (IST)). The transcripts of the meetings (chats) will be available in [meetings](https://github.com/vchrombie/gsoc/blob/master/meetings) directory.
3. I will be writing a blog post every week (mostly on Monday) explaining the work I did over the week. You can find the links to the work summary and blog posts in the [work](https://github.com/vchrombie/gsoc/blob/master/work) directory.
4. I need to open an issue in the governance repository where I will be posting the work updates and links to blog posts.
> Created the issue, [chaoss/governance#205](https://github.com/chaoss/governance/issues/205).
5. After publishing the blog, write a short summary and send it to the CHAOSS and GrimoireLab mailing list along with the blog links.

That's it for this week. I have got some work assigned during the community bonding. 

- Explore a possible alternative to represent the quality model dendrogram with JS libraries.
- UML diagram (or any similar representation) of the current implementation of Prosoul.
- Try to work on the issue [Bitergia/prosoul#53](https://github.com/Bitergia/prosoul/issues/53), before making any additional improvements in Prosoul. 
- Explore how to create an enriched index with a format similar to the one consumed by Prosoul. The target data for this evaluation could GitHub issues (or anything that is easy to process).
- Explore how to create a study index with a format similar to the one consumed by Prosoul. The target data for this evaluation could GitHub issues (or anything that is easy to process).

I will be working on the above-mentioned tasks in the coming weeks of the community bonding.
