#### Coding Period 1, Week 1: Baby steps üê•.

Hola!

We entered the official coding period ü•≥ and I'm here with the report of the work done in the first week of the coding period. We had a meeting, [2020-06-04-coding-period-1-week-1.txt](https://github.com/vchrombie/gsoc/blob/master/meetings/2020-06-04-coding-period-1-week-1.txt), a few days back and we discussed the completed work till now and planned some work for the upcoming week. I'm expecting to show a small working demo of the project this Friday (hopefully ü§û).

During the last week's meeting of the community bonding, I planned to start working on the QM enrichers and I picked gitlab as my first option because I was already working on _gitlabcomments_ enricher. I opened an issue to track its progress. [vchrombie/gsoc#6](https://github.com/vchrombie/gsoc/issues/6)

I implemented the basic structure of the QM enrichers. I planned to have a parent class `QMEnrich` which is inherited by the child class `QMGitLabEnrich`. I would be following the same approach as the qm enrichers might share a few things (mapping) in common.

parent
```noLineNumbers
class QMMapping(BaseMapping):

    def get_elastic_mappings(es_major):


class QMEnrich(Enrich):
    mapping = QMMapping
```

child (enricher)
```noLineNumbers
class QMGitLabEnrich(QMEnrich):

    def __init__()

    def enrich_items(self, ocean_backend):

```

The main step of building an enricher is to get a minimal idea üí≠ of the data format of the enriched item. I checked the existing index format which I used during the [microtask-9](https://github.com/vchrombie/chaoss-microtasks/tree/master/microtask-9). I was able to figure out a decent format of the index which can be consumed by Prosoul. Ideally, the enricher should perform queries to get the data for every day.

For example: If we want to measure the number of issues opened, the enriched data should be a document per day giving the value of the number of issues opened that day. (something like)

```
{
  "Date" : "20181229",
  "numberOfIssuesOpened" : 8
},
{
  "Date" : "20181230",
  "numberOfIssuesOpened" : 5
},
```

I need to change the format a bit (as we don't need a few items üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è). [vchrombie/gsoc#7](https://github.com/vchrombie/gsoc/issues/7)


I was contemplating about the metrics that can be extracted from the gitlab data. Valerio suggested a few metrics.
- number of issues per day
- number of comments per day
- number of merges per day

I was thinking over it and felt we can divide these metrics into some more detail. ü§î
- number of issues per day
    - number of issued opened per day
    - number of issues closed per day
    - number of issues attended per day

I got this idea from this quality model, [developer_model.json](https://github.com/Bitergia/prosoul/blob/master/django-prosoul/prosoul/data/developer_model.json). We need to dig more into these metrics and find all that metrics which we can extract from the gitlab data (versions, labels, milestones). I will check the existing qms for more inspiration. [vchrombie/gsoc#8](https://github.com/vchrombie/gsoc/issues/8)


Other than planned in the timeline, I also worked on the _gitlabcomments_ enricher ([chaoss/grimoirelab-elk#881](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-elk/pull/881)) and achieved a considerable target ü§ò. I completed working on the enricher and Valerio pointed out some mistakes which I corrected and got the enricher working. 

Valerio also found out the peculiar mapping of this enricher. The implementation of `__get-reactions()` (which stores the reaction data of issues/mrs/comments) creates a mapping with each reaction separately, resulting in a lot of unnecessary mapping being created.

```
  "project": {
    "type": "keyword"
  },
  "reaction_100" : {
    "type" : "long"
  },
  "reaction_basketball_player" : {
    "type" : "long"
  },
  "reaction_bow" : {
    "type" : "long"
  },
  "repository": {
    "type": "keyword"
  },
  "sub_type": {
    "type": "keyword"
  },
```

We discussed it and Valerio suggested a new mapping. We had to change the logic according to the new mapping.

```
  "project": {
    "type": "keyword"
  },
  "reactions": {
    "properties": {
      "count": {
        "type": "long"
      },
      "type": {
        "type": "keyword"
      }
    }
  },
  "repository": {
    "type": "keyword"
  },
```

This mapping and implementation stores the data as

```noLineNumbers
  "reactions": [
    {
      "type": "rocket",
      "count": 1
    },
    {
      "type": "smiley",
      "count": 2
    },
    {
      "type": "thumbsup",
      "count": 4
    }
  ],
```

Now the mapping makes more sense. The enricher and configurations are completed, schema and tests are pending. [vchrombie/gsoc#4](https://github.com/vchrombie/gsoc/issues/4)
