Hello everyone

I almost finished the second week of the community bonding period and came with another blog post to share my work update. I also had an awesome meeting with the mentors of the project, as said before, on last Thursday (14th May). You can find the log of the meeting here, [2020-05-14-community-bonding-2.txt](https://github.com/vchrombie/gsoc/blob/master/meetings/2020-05-14-community-bonding-2.txt). 

As mentioned in the earlier blog post, [uni√≥n comunitaria 1](https://vchrombie.github.io/blog/community-bonding-1), I worked mostly around ELK during this week. I started looking into enrichers in grimoirelab-elk, one of the main components of GrimoireLab. It offers a convenient way to store perceval raw data üì§ and processes & enriches the data üóÇÔ∏è which can be consumed by Kibiter. üìä

ELK stores the Perceval data in ES indexes as raw documents (raw data), [grimoire_elk/raw](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-elk/tree/master/grimoire_elk/raw). The enrichers of ELK enrich the raw data, removes the unnecessary data and adds some other information like identities & organization (from SortingHat) and stores them as JSON documents, [grimoire_elk/enriched](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-elk/tree/master/grimoire_elk/enriched). These JSON documents has information linked to the corresponding raw documents to ease debugging and guarantee traceability and are ready to use (just like the pancakesü•û üôä).

I went through a few examples of simple enrichers like [slack.py](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-elk/blob/master/grimoire_elk/enriched/slack.py), [gitlab.py](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-elk/blob/master/grimoire_elk/enriched/gitlab.py), shared by Valerio. I'm hoping to work on adding or improving some enricher in the coming days. Once I have some good experience with the enrichers, the next step is to figure out the structure of the enriched data which is easily consumed by Prosoul.

Apart from that, I opened a PR for adding perceval support to Zulip chat, [chaoss/grimoirelab-perceval#667](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-perceval/pull/667). I have proposed this feature during the application period and now I started working on it. I have sent a draft PR, there is a lot of work pending tho. I am planning to complete this by the next week. I will work on this enricher once the PR is in good shape. 

Also, I have opened a couple of issues in the perceval repository.
  - Found that googlehits backend was not working since the id used to parse the data is changed. Following up on the discussion and looking forward to fixing it, [chaoss/grimoirelab-perceval#668](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-perceval/issues/668).
  - Proposed a new feature for adding perceval support to Trello. We need to discuss the feasibility of storing all the backends in the same repository or different repositories. So, this feature [chaoss/grimoirelab-perceval#664](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-perceval/issues/664) might need to wait.
  - Proposed having an issue template, but it was already suggested and we need to discuss it, [chaoss/grimoirelab-perceval#665](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-perceval/issues/665).
