Hi everyone, good to see you around. Recently, we worked on designing a complete workflow to automate the release process. GrimoireLab toolset has different components, some of them work as individual tools like Perceval, SortingHat. The maintainers have to put a lot of effort for reviewing the contributions, making release notes, releasing the latest versions on PyPI and all the other things. The main aim is to automate most of these things to make the maintainer job easy. I'll be explaining about the workflow in this blog post.
