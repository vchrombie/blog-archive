#### Coding Period 1, Week 3: Lot of experiments ‚öóÔ∏è.

Hello

I hope you are doing great. I'm back with another update on the coding period. So, the third week of the coding period is completed. üí™

We had a meeting, [2020-06-19-coding-period-1-week-3.txt](https://github.com/vchrombie/gsoc/blob/master/meetings/2020-06-19-coding-period-1-week-3.txt), on last Friday (we couldn't meet on Thursday as I had some connection issues). I updated the mentors with the results of _gitlabqm_ enricher. The next meeting is next Thursday and we planned to have a video call to demonstrate the results I could acheive in the first coding period.

I was only focusing on building an enricher that converts the gitlab raw data to enriched items that can be fed to Prosoul. The approach for making this enricher was simple, fetch all the raw items and filter them into a complex nested-dictionary data structure and fill it using the extracted metric values. Later, using this data structure, generate the enriched items. I framed and shaped this approach as we have a definite format of the data item which can be consumed by Prosoul.

The data format consumed by Prosoul has some important fields. [vchrombie/gsoc#7](https://github.com/vchrombie/gsoc/issues/7)
```
{
  ...
  ...
  "metric_id": "issues.numberCreatedIssues",
  "metric_name": "Number of Created Issues",
  "project": "cms-mobile",
  "datetime": "2020-05-27T00:00:00+00:00",
  "metric_es_value": 1,
  ...
}
```

So, I started to frame the best format of the data structure which suits the use case. I experimented a lot and came up with an initial version of it.
```
{
  'cms-mobile': {
    'created_issue': {
      '2020-05-27T00:00:00+00:00': 1,
      ...
    },
    'closed_issue': {
      '2020-06-27T00:00:00+00:00': 1,
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

Using this, I made the initial working model of the enricher and submitted it for review. Valerio pointed out some mistakes, there were many faults in the implementation and the data structure. üëæ [vchrombie/gsoc#6](https://github.com/vchrombie/gsoc/issues/6), PR üëâ [chaoss/grimoirelab-elk#892](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-elk/pull/892)

So, I spent some more time on making the workflow more clear and less prone to mistakes. I revamped the data structure and finally, after a lot of trials, made another which suits the requirements for the enricher.
```
{
  'project': 'cms-mobile',
  'data': {
    'created_issue': {
      '2020-05-27T00:00:00+00:00': 1,
      '2020-08-27T00:00:00+00:00': 2,
      ...
    },
    'closed_issue': {
      '2020-05-27T00:00:00+00:00': 1,
      '2020-08-27T00:00:00+00:00': 5,
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

I was successfully able to extract the metrics (initial metrics were the number of issues created/opened per day, number of issues closed per day) and built this data structure with all the values. üéä

The next challenge was with generating the enriched items which had other fields too like `metric_id`, `metric_name`, `metric_description`, etc. As these were based on the metric we are generating at that moment, so I made use of the metric id which we used in building the data structure (`created_issue`, `closed_issue`). After a few hours of debugging and fixing the loopholes, the enricher was working perfectly fine and the items (only issues by then) were generated according to the format.

After Valerio's suggestion, I tried using them with Prosoul. I made a simple QM with only two metrics (`issues.numberCreatedIssues`, `issues.numberClosedIssues`) and performed an assessment. It was a hit in the first attempt, I was able to complete the assessment and generate reports. The dashboard had some problem, I'll look into it. üìä

Well, I had sometime before the weekend. So, I tried adding support for merge request related metrics too. I finished that too and I had to refactor the whole code to remove the redundant pieces. [vchrombie/gsoc#8](https://github.com/vchrombie/gsoc/issues/8)

I also made a dashboard with some visualizations in it so that it would be easy to analyze the items when I'm trying on different projects. üìà

Here are the results when I tried the enricher and visualizations on a couple of [GitLab.org](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/) projects.

I'm almost done with this enricher. I'll be working on the _gitqm_ and _pipermailqm_ enrichers in the coming week. üï∫
