#### Coding Period 3, Week 12: Documentation of the project üóíÔ∏è.

We are almost near the end of the third phase and also to the Google Summer of Code 2020 program. This post would be the last weekly update on my blog. We had a meeting previous Thursday the final finishing steps of the project. You can find the log here, [2020-08-20-coding-period-3-week-12.txt](https://github.com/vchrombie/gsoc/blob/master/meetings/2020-08-20-coding-period-3-week-12.txt).

This week, most of the work was around finalizing the PR. Also, I worked on the documentation of the project. [vchrombie/gsoc#20](https://github.com/vchrombie/gsoc/issues/20)

I worked on revamping existing the prosoul with grimoirelab doc and updated it with the latest workflow ‚ú® ([Bitergia/prosoul#216](https://github.com/Bitergia/prosoul/pull/216)), and also updated the repository with the latest docker-compose file ([Bitergia/prosoul#215](https://github.com/Bitergia/prosoul/pull/215)) and latest images ([Bitergia/prosoul#213](https://github.com/Bitergia/prosoul/pull/213)) too. Thanks to Valerio, who helped me with designing them.

I submitted a PR to sirmordred repo, adding the configurations and documentation of the enrichers. [chaoss/grimoirelab-sirmordred#486](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-sirmordred/pull/486)

I started making some walk-through videos üé• of how to use Prosoul and a workflow video of my work. I started working on the end evaluation report too. I'll be publishing my final report as a blog post soon. üòÉ
