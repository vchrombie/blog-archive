#### Coding Period 2, Week 7: More Data Sources ü§π.

I'm back with the seventh-week update of my work. We had a meeting last Thursday about the updates and the work for next week. You can find the log here, [2020-07-16-coding-period-2-week-7.txt](https://github.com/vchrombie/gsoc/blob/master/meetings/2020-07-16-coding-period-2-week-7.txt).

This week, I mostly focused on adding support for other data sources like pipermail and meetup. We discussed the metrics that we can add for _pipermailqm_. [vchrombie/gsoc#11](https://github.com/vchrombie/gsoc/issues/11)
  - number of emails
  - number of replies
  - number of threads
  - number of users

I worked on these metrics and implemented all of them. üíØ

We also discussed the metrics and implementation possibilities for _meetupqm_. [vchrombie/gsoc#14](https://github.com/vchrombie/gsoc/issues/14)
  - number of RSVPs
  - number of comments
  - number of yes RSVPs

There is one particular case in the meetup metrics. The number of yes RSVPs is not a _per-day_ metric, unlike the other. It would be a _per-event_ metric. We decided to use the event date as the required datetime field. üï¥Ô∏è

There were two pending metrics from the gitlabqm (number of issues/merge requests attended) that we proposed earlier. I completed their implementation this week. [vchrombie/gsoc#8](https://github.com/vchrombie/gsoc/issues/8)

Now that we will have meetup on the list, we are planning to do a pilot study on all the projects of [GitLab.org](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/) in the upcoming week. I'll also work on finishing the meetupqm enricher and work on tests for enrichers too in the next week.

If you have any comments or questions, please make sure to comment down below. :)
